Description: Joint dimension reduction and spatial clustering is conducted for
    Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data, and more details can be referred to 
    Wei Liu, Xu Liao, Xiang Zhou, Shijie Shi and Jin Liu. (2021) <doi:10.1101/2021.12.25.474153>. It is not only computationally efficient and scalable to the sample size increment, but also is capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters as well.
